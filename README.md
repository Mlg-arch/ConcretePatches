# Concrete Patches

*Modernizing [RF] Concrete*

**Description:**

Concrete Patches revitalizes and modernizes the classic [RF] Concrete mod, bringing it up to date with new features, tweaks, and improvements. With a focus on enhancing gameplay, customization, and graphical updates, this mod breathes new life into your (my) favorite Rimworld concrete-adding mod.

**Features:**

- **Grouped Buildings**: Organizes buildings added by [RF] Concrete for easier management and navigation.

- **Building Tweaks**: Adjusts asphalt and concrete tiles and buildings to require concrete. Sandbags now require sand to be built.

- **Research Prerequisites**: Adds research prerequisites to prevent tribals from constructing concrete structures immediately, adding depth and realism to technological progression.

- **Customization Options**: Offers various options for gameplay tweaks and adjustments to suit your playstyle.

- **Updated Textures/Graphics**: Refreshes the mod's textures and graphics for a more visually appealing experience.

**Mod Options:**

1. **Hardmode**: Changes building recipes to be more realistic, requiring cement for most stone floors and concrete for armoured walls and floors.

2. **Hardmode Walls**: Divides vanilla walls in metallic/woody and stony-based walls, with stony walls requiring cement.

3. **Vanilla Factions Expanded - Ancients Integration**: Adjusts Cement Press yield for realism, with options for different outputs (cinder blocks or cement).

4. **Higher Cement Yield from Limestone**: Increases cement output from limestone-using recipes.

5. **Disable [RF] Concrete Embrasures**: Removes [RF] Concrete Embrasures for those preferring other mods' embrasures.

6. **Disable [RF] Concrete Reinforced Doors**: Disables reinforced doors from [RF] Concrete for alternative door options.

7. **Disable [RF] Concrete Reinforced Walls**: Removes reinforced walls from [RF] Concrete for alternative wall choices.

8. **Remove Rimnauts 2 Steel Bridge**: Eliminates the steel bridge from Rimnauts 2 mod if considered redundant.

9. **Use Soil Relocation Framework Sand**: Integrates sand from Soil Relocation Framework for compatibility and consistency.

10. **Integrate with Expanded Materials - Stones and Mortars**: Integrates with Expanded Materials - Stones and Mortars mod, enhancing recipe options. Untested as the mod is not updated to 1.5.

Experience a refreshed and enhanced [RF] Concrete with Concrete Patches, offering a modernized gameplay experience tailored to your preferences.
